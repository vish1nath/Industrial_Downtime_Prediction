I am working on model to predict the downtime of an Industrial asset based on its everyday sensor data.


In order to run the files run

./Data_transformation.sh

and then run model.sh with Argument as 
LR for Logistic Regression  (./model LR)
NB for Naive Bayes          (./model NB)  
RF for Random Forest        (./model RF)
GB for gradient boosting    (./model GB)

Please read the Predicting the Downtime document to find the results of this model.
