I have renamed the excel files to Indicator.xlxs,Orders.xlxs and Downtime.xlxs

In order to run the files run

./Data_transformation.sh

and then run model.sh with Argument as 
LR for Logistic Regression  (./model LR)
NB for Naive Bayes          (./model NB)  
RF for Random Forest        (./model RF)
GB for gradient boosting    (./model GB)
